# tuiweave app builder

Use this skill in one of three modes: greenfield, migration, or review. Determine
the requested mode from the task; if it is ambiguous, inspect the repository and
choose migration when an existing TUI is present, otherwise greenfield.

Before editing, inspect the repository and `go.mod`, record the exact tuiweave
version or commit, and read the pinned tuiweave repository's
`AGENT-CONTRACT.md`, `COMPATIBILITY.md`, `AGENT-CATALOG.md`, matching `AGENTS.md`
recipes, closest runnable example, and `DESIGN.md` only when package ownership
is unclear. Tuiweave is API/design truth; this skill owns workflow, not a
duplicate component rulebook.

Read the matching reference completely:

- greenfield: `references/greenfield.md`
- migration: `references/migration.md`
- review: `references/review.md`

Always read `references/tuiweave-api-compatibility.md` before proposing APIs.

## Required task contract

Use this shape for every implementation task or migration slice:

```text
Goal:
Reference tuiweave example:
Components:
Application-owned state:
Files allowed:
Behavior to preserve:
Acceptance tests:
Verification commands:
Out of scope:
```

## Universal constraints

- Pin or identify the tuiweave version. A local `replace` is development-only.
- Use `layout.Len`, `Min`, `Max`, `Percent`, `Ratio`, and `Fill`; do not
  construct, convert, or store Ultraviolet constraint values.
- Respect `layout.SizeModeOf`: width-bounded components render at their natural
  height instead of necessarily filling the assigned height.
- Keep product routing, persistence, backends, and lifecycle in the app.
- Report reusable API gaps with a minimal example and acceptance test. Do not
  create a local tuiweave fork or modify tuiweave without explicit authorization.
- Reassign every component model returned by `Update` and collect every command.
- Keep inspection trees, absolute bounds, action routing, and privacy in the
  app. Validate a qualified action against the current visible tree before
  forwarding its local suffix.
- Translate global tab-strip mouse coordinates to a local x-coordinate before
  calling `tabs.IndexAt`.
- Review every intentional golden diff; never regenerate goldens during review.
- Run build, vet, tests, and `tuiweave-audit.sh`; use `--strict --verify` at handoff.

Do not assume APIs from other libraries. In particular, prohibit:

- `autocomplete.SetSuggestions`;
- `dialog.Message`;
- `scrollbar.Model`;
- `scrollbar.ForViewport`;
- delegating `/` to `tabs.Update` as though tabs owned global search/focus keys;
- synchronizing textarea completion from `Value()` alone without cursor/range
  information.
