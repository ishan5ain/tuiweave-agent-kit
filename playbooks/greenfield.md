# Greenfield playbook

1. Inspect the repository, `go.mod`, Go version, current test conventions, and
   the pinned tuiweave tag or commit. Read tuiweave's `AGENT-CATALOG.md`, matching
   `AGENTS.md` recipes, and the closest runnable example.
2. Write a component map, layout rectangles, focus order, message/result flow,
   and application-owned state map. Keep backend clients, persistence, and
   product orchestration outside tuiweave components.
3. Create tasks using the standard task contract. Start with the smallest
   working shell: root model, `WindowSizeMsg` layout, sizing, focus, delegation,
   and one composed `tea.View`.
4. Add behavior in vertical slices. Always reassign component models returned
   by `Update` and collect every `tea.Cmd`.
5. Add readable snapshots for default, focused, empty/full, and narrow states;
   add named scenarios for meaningful transitions and command delivery.
6. Run build, vet, tests, intentional golden update/review, and
   `tuiweave-audit.sh --strict --verify`.

Pin tuiweave in committed configuration. A local `replace` directive may be used
temporarily during development and should not become the release dependency.
Gotui changes require explicit authorization.
